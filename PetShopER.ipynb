        "The pet shop entity-relationship diagram shows the relationship between the entities of a pet shop. The entities that I have created for this Pet Shop ER are pets, food, enclosures, customers, the transaction of pets, and transactions of food. The entity of pets consisted of the attributes of type, name, location, food type, and license number, which is the primary key. A foreign key of location in the entity pet connects to the entity enclosures' primary key of  the enclosure number. One to twenty pets are kept in one and only one enclosure. Other attributes that are within the entity enclosures are size, type, and the number of pets. Another entity is the food, it consists of the attributes brand, pet type, texture, barcode, and serial number, which is the primary key. That primary key is related to the foreign key of food ID in the entity customers also the foreign key of food type in the pet entity. One and only one pet eats between one and one thousand food. One to ten foods are bought by one, and only one customer. Customer entity consists of the attributes first name, email, last name, phone number, food ID, the primary key Loyalty program ID, and the foreign key of purchase which, is related to the entities of the transaction of pets and transactions of food. Customers make a transaction of pets and transaction of food. One and only one customer makes 1 to 5 transactions of pets and 1 to 10 transactions of food. The transaction of the pets entity consists of the attributes cost, certificate, pet type, and the primary key pet ID number. The attributes of the transaction of food entity are price, brand, OR code, and barcode, which is the primary key."
